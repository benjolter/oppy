# Transaction Fees (Gas Fees)

Transaction fees are paid for compensating Oppy chain miners for the computing power and storage costs they have to use to verify Oppy chain transactions. It is paid in OPPY tokens and distributed to the validators. &#x20;

In order to encourage new users coming into Oppy and get familiar with the system, **at the springboard period, the gas fees are** <mark style="color:red;">**zero**</mark>**.** Oppy community can vote to decide when to charge the gas fees. To make it fair for the miners, Oppy has a gradual decrease token release schedule mechanism that the miners will get much more Oppy tokens at the early days from staking program as compensation for zero gas fees.

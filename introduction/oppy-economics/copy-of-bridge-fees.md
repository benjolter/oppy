# Copy of Bridge Fees

### **Bridges fees to cosmos ecosystem chains:**

<mark style="color:red;">**ZERO.**</mark>

OPPY is connected to almost all the chains in Cosmos ecosystem via IBC, such as Cosmos, Osmosis, Terra, Kava, Sifchain etc.    &#x20;

&#x20;**** There is no bridge fees to connect these chains since OPPY is also build part of the cosmos ecosystem.

&#x20;****&#x20;

### **Bridge fees to EVM ecosystem chains such as Binance smart chain and Ethereum:**

### &#x20;**Inbound fees:**&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**ZERO.**</mark>

&#x20;Unlike most of the bridges, OPPY does not charge any inbound fees.

### &#x20;**Outbound fees:**

Oppy will charge about three times the stored gas cost for the outbound destination chain.  One time of the gas fees will be paid to the destination chain. The other two times of the gas fees will be split between Validators/Pools.

There is a hypothetical network gas fees calculation at below.&#x20;

The outbounds fees are charged in destination chain tokens.  For example, if the destination chain is BSC smart chain, the outbound fees are charged in BNB,  if the destination chain is Ethereum, the outbound fees are charged in ETH.

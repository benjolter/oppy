(b) User acknowledges that Blockchains and smart contracts are still emerging technologies that carry a relatively high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. For example, User’s assets interacting with the Services may be vulnerable to hacking events. The mere access to and interaction with blockchains and smart contracts requires a high degree of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including (without limitation) use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies (such as blockchains) is variable and highly volatile.

The User further represents that it has all knowledge sufficient to work, and is informed of all foreseeable risks, and the possibility of unforeseeable risks, associated with blockchains, crypto-assets, Web3 Utilities, smart contracts, Services and the Website. The User further acknowledges that any crypto-assets the User places or uses within the Website and Services may increase or decrease in value rapidly while they are involved with the Website and Services, or be obtained by other parties or otherwise lost in ways the User may or may not currently foresee (possibly to the User’s severe harm or detriment). The User agrees that we are not responsible for any of these (or related) risks, do not own or control the Website and Services, and cannot be held liable for any resulting harms, damages, or losses incurred by or against the User experiences while accessing or using the Website and Services. Accordingly, the User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all the risks of accessing and using the Website and interacting with the Services, whether mentioned in this section or otherwise. The User further expressly waives and releases us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to the User’s use of the Website and Services. If the User is a California resident, the User waives the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which states: “\[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

# OPPY Chain Tech Parts

Oppy is the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) based proof-of-stake public blockchain that is built on the Cosmos digital ecosystem. Oppy has a robust transaction throughput while preserving the safety of the assets within our chain.

The Oppy chain is built on up to 11 active validators which generate and broadcast the blocks to the network. Validators who participate in the block generation will be paid by the transaction fee, bridge fees plus the incentives emitted from the Oppy project. We anticipate there will be a need to have more active validators, as the demand for Oppy increases.

The selection of the validators is based on the total Oppy they staked plus the age of the validation. The details of the validators' election can be found in the section here.

To maintain the health and longevity of the Oppy chain, a punishment policy is introduced to the system to penalize the validators that perform negatively within the Oppy chain. The misbehavior of the validators may be sent to 'jail' (which will stop them from incurring the Oppy chain rewards) for a certain amount of time or even lose a portion of their total sums deposited and the ability to use our platform.

Oppy also welcomes investors who do not have enough Oppy to run a validator. These nodes can delegate their Oppy to one of the active validators and get the Oppy rewards once their delegated validators are participating within our Oppy ecosystem.

### Key Terminologies:

**Active Validators:** Active validators are the nodes participants in the block generation.

**Candidate Validators:** Candidate validators are the nodes that maybe choose to be the validators in the coming validator election.

**Inactive Validators:** Inactive validators are the nodes that are ineligible to participate in the Oppy block generation.

In each churn round, the voting power of the validator is calculated as follows:

$$
voting power = permanetpower+temporarypower
$$

â€‹**Temporary power:** Is the value that is reduced based on the age of a validator. For all the validator candidates, the initial temporary voting power for all the nodes is the same. Each churn round, the temporary voting power of an active validator is deducted with a given digit. Once a validator is kicked out from the active validator set, its temporary power will be reset.

**Permanent power:** Is the value calculated based on the staking of a given node. It will not be affected by the transferring of the validator status. The permanent power is updated according to the updates of the validators' staking balance.

**Slashing Point:** Is a mechanism that is built within the proof of stake blockchain protocol, that then discourages the misbehavior. Slashing is essentially designed to incentivize nodes that are secure, available and participating within the network.

Each Churn, all the of the validators voting power will be calculated, the up to top 11 nodes will be the active validators that participant in the block generation while the rest of the candidates need to wait for the next churn.
